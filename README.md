TenmoApplication
A console application which replicates Venmo. This application is an online payment service that allows a user to transfer "TE Bucks" between friends. I completed this project with @cait-mede at Tech Elevator.

Users can:

register and log in to the system.
check their account balance.
send TE Bucks to other users of their choice
see a list of transfers that they have sent or recieved
see transfer details
request money from other uses
see requests that other users have sent them
choice to approve or deny those requests
see a list of pending requests they sent but that other users have not responded to
Technologies Used:

Java, Spring Boot, RESTful API services, PostgreSQL, JDBCTemplate
